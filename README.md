Changelog

### 12.5: February 4th, 2020
Enhancements:

* Adds a Yoast SEO section to the WooCommerce product data metabox that allows entering a GTIN, ISBN and MPN number.
* Analyzes the content of the short description as part of the page content.
* Throws a warning when WooCommerce is not active.
* Adjusts the wording for when Yoast SEO is not active.
* Schema: 
    * Adds an `@id` attribute to every individual review.
    * Adds a `name` attribute to every individual review.
    * Adds an `@id` attribute to every offer.
    * Adds a `productID` attribute to the `Product` output.
    * Adds a `gtin8` attribute to the `Product` output.
    * Adds a `gtin12` attribute to the `Product` output.
    * Adds a `gtin13` attribute to the `Product` output.
    * Adds a `gtin14` attribute to the `Product` output.
    * Adds a `mpn` attribute to the `Product` output.
    * Adds an `isbn` attribute to the `Product` output. If an ISBN number is set, it double types the schema output to `[ Product, Book ]`. By double typing it, the Product can have the attributes of both schema.org/Book and schema.org/Product, and thus it can have an ISBN attribute and a price etc.
    * Removes the `priceValidUntil` attribute, as it's not sensible.
* OpenGraph:    
    * Adds a `product:condition` meta tag to the OpenGraph output. It defaults to `new` but can be filtered using the new `Yoast\WP\Woocommerce\product_condition` filter.
    * Adds a `product:retailer_item_id` meta tag to the OpenGraph output for Facebook Catalog usage.
* Don't try to use the WooCommerce shop page in the sitemap when it is not set in WooCommerce.

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where the `product:brand` meta tag would not always be the selected primary term.
* Fixes a bug where the `product:availability` meta tag would be set to `instock` instead of the correct `in stock`.
* Fixes a bug where a PHP notice would be thrown on products with variations where a variation lacked an image.
* Fixes a bug where Organization would be used in the schema output, while no organization was set.
* Fixes a bug where non-public taxonomies could be chosen as manufacturer and brand.
* Fixes a bug where the shop page would be shown in the XML sitemap when it was set to `noindex`. Props [stodorovic](https://github.com/stodorovic).
* Fixes a bug where an empty `product:retailer_item_id` was output when there was no SKU.
